        "interface like PyTorch’s. This gives users the ability to write\n",
        "familiar, idiomatic Python, allowing for the use of Python data\n",
        "structures, control flow operations, print statements, and debugging\n",

        "research and experimentation applications, when it comes time to deploy\n",
        "the model in a production environment, having a **graph**-based model\n",
        "representation is very beneficial. A deferred graph representation\n",
        "allows for optimizations such as out-of-order execution, and the ability\n",
        "to target highly optimized hardware architectures. Also, a graph-based\n",
        "representation enables framework-agnostic model exportation. PyTorch\n",
        "provides mechanisms for incrementally converting eager-mode code into\n",
        "TorchScript, a statically analyzable and optimizable subset of Python\n",
        "that Torch uses to represent deep learning programs independently from\n",
        "the Python runtime.\n",
        "\n",
        "The API for converting eager-mode PyTorch programs into TorchScript is\n",
        "found in the torch.jit module. This module has two core modalities for\n",
        "converting an eager-mode model to a TorchScript graph representation:\n",
        "**tracing** and **scripting**. The ``torch.jit.trace`` function takes a\n",
        "module or function and a set of example inputs. It then runs the example\n",
        "input through the function or module while tracing the computational\n",
